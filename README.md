# ml-favorites-list
Building a machine learning favorites list algorithm for the [Kardia tool suite](https://kardia.sourceforge.net/vision.php).

## NOTE FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS
All the relevant files are stored on the Riot server (CaT2024: Favorites List via ML). The PPTX is also located in the same place.

## Promising Resources
These look like they could be powerful and helpful to achieving the project goals, but due to scope and time we weren't able to look much into them.
